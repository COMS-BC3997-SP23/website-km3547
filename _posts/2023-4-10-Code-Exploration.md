title: Code Exploration
---

My initial roadmap had hardware completely finished by spring break, and code exploration after we returned from spring break. I didn't put finishing on the hardware just yet, but I decided it was time to start exploring the [DonkeyCar code library](http://docs.donkeycar.com/) that I plan on using to operate the car. DonkeyCar is a Self-Driving platform for RC hobby cars that has multiple components: 
* It is an Open Source Hardware design that makes it easy for you to build your own car 
* It is a simulator that enables you to use Donkey without hardware 
* It is a community of enthusiasts, developers and data scientists that enjoy racing, coding and discussing the future of ML, Cars and who will win the next race.

Throughout hardware construction I used a lot of guidance from this library with intentions to fully utilize this library. I met with Professor Plancher in order to understand all of the moving parts, and professor Plancher suggested I should create my own code library to operate my car instead of dealing with all of the extraneous files and functions that Donkey Car offers
